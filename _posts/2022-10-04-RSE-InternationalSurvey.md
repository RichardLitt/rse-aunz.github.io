Dear RSEs,

The RSE-AUNZ Steering Committee collaborated on reviewing the International RSE survey earlier this year. The Research Software Engineering (RSE) International Survey: 2022 results are now available [https://softwaresaved.github.io/international-survey-2022/](https://softwaresaved.github.io/international-survey-2022/) to help understand the RSE community, inform policies and create incentives that advance RSE interests. 

Members of the Steering Committee: Nooriyah Lohani and Paula Martinez will present a short update on our RSE communities in Australia and New Zealand at eResearch Australasia on Oct 18th at 09:50 â€“ 10:10 AEST. You can find the [abstract](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/2022/08/what-can-we-learn-about-our-rse-communities-in-australia-and-new-zealand-from-the-international-rse-survey/) linked from the [eresearch program page](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/2022-program/).
