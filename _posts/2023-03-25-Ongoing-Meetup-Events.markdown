The Research Software Engineer Association of Australia and New Zealand (RSE-AUNZ) are organising regular local meetups. There is a [form that you can fill out to get on the mailing list for each area that has a coordinator](https://forms.gle/JJjqnjvpxAFmnpsh9). Currently we have coordinators for Parkville in Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane and Monash in Melbourne. You can also request for another location and volunteer to be a coordinator in the form.

Coordinator roles take about 2 hours a month, 1 hour for choosing a regular date/time/location to meet and emailing reminders to the mailing list, and 1 hour for going to the meetup itself.
