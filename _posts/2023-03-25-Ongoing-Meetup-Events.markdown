We have two confirmed local catch ups organised so far:
- Varvara is the coordinator for Canberra - 12:30pm Tuesday the 28th of March at 5 Liversidge St, ANU
- Rowland is the coordinator for Melbourne Parkville - 12.30pm the 12th of April at Dr. Dax, 30 Royal Parade, Parkville.

To make things easier, I have created a [Google Form that you can fill out to get on the mailing list for each area](https://forms.gle/JJjqnjvpxAFmnpsh9).

It allows you to:
- Add your email address to the available areas mailing list,
- Add another region that you would like to be considered for a meetup/mailing list. 
- Mention that you would be willing to be a coordinator (Choose a date/time/location, email the mailing list to remind - about 2 hours a month)

Out of the other areas that were asked for in the form:
- Rowland is the coordinator for Monash, but we haven't setup a lunch yet.
- Paula is the coordinator for Brisbane, but we haven't setup a lunch yet.
- South Australia was asked for but we don't have a coordinator yet.
- Sydney was asked for but we don't have a coordinator yet.
